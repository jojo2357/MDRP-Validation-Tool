# MDRP-Validation-Tool
This is another tool that I made for [Music Discord Rich Presence](https://github.com/jojo2357/Music-Discord-Rich-Presence) (MDRP) and the purpose is to validate/help diagnose problems with data files.

This repo is where any questions about album art failing to show up should be opened since 9 times out of 10 it is a local problem and not MDRP behaving incorrectly.

This repo is also for the troopers that are assembling their data files by hand. For those that would like the easy(er) way, take a look at the [other tool](https://github.com/jojo2357/Music-Discord-Rich-Presence-Library)

## To Use
- Go to https://jojo2357.github.io/MDRP-Validation-Tool/ and upload your dat file.
- note: If you are paranoid like I am, dont worry. The tool uses javascript and html which run in your browser so when you "upload a file" it doesnt go anywhere since the whole thing runs locally. privacy=maximum
- Read the output. Feel free to make issues or open discussions if you have any questions at all.
